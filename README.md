# Drumamine

Playing around with making a drum machine using some of the awesome Web Audio APIs. It's a messy hack-fest right now,
so I wouldn't really recommend trying to find much value here yet. Maybe some day...

I'll add a link here once I have it to a state where I'm not too embarrassed to host it somewhere.

**Note**: the samples referenced in `App.tsx` are not committed to Git, so if you are going to attempt to pull this
and run it locally, you will need to provide your own samples in `public/sounds`. You can either name them the same
as the ones referenced, or just change the references.
